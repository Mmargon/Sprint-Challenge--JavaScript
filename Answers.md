1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

* '.forEach' iterates through each item, but '.map' iterates through each item and returns a new array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

* A function does not belong to an object or a class, a method is defined inside an object or class.

3. What is closure?

* Basically, closure is a function within a function. In other words, an inner function has access to the outer function's variables.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

* If a fuction in contained in the global scope, "this" will be the window object.
  If a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before the dot is "this".
  When call or apply method is used, "this" is explicitly defined.
  In a constructor function, "this" refers to the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

* The super keyword accesses the object's parent.
